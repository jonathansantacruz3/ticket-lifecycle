<h2>Lifecycle Stages</h2>

In this project I will be role playing as a help desk professional and as an end user (customer). The ticket queue will usually be open with necessary modifications to reflect their true severity nature. 
Also, the queue manager will assign tickets to the corresponding agents or teams depending on the help topic. The tickets will need to be reviewed and updated to make sure it meets the SLAs for a given company. The ticket will keep a record of all the updates in its history bank so that anyone with access and permissions can view what progress has been made. 



This is the URL the end user will utilize to access the help desk web site.

This is the screen where the end user can create new tickets.

The end user will fill out the form depending on their needs. In this example, the mobile banking system is down and is a business critical outage help topic.

I created another ticket that has a low priority SLA and more of an inquisition.

Once the tickets were created, I logged off and logged in as a help desk professional.

The tickets in the queue are usually not assigned to anyone until the queue manager assigns it to an agents. I went through and assigned SLAs, priorities, and tickets to agents 

If it is business impacting then I changed the priority level from normal to high/emergency and assigned it to the proper help desk professional that will resolve the issue quickly.

Update SLA once the ticket has been reviewed.

Some users can set their own SLA, regardless if it is high priority or not. I needed to downgrade or upgrade it depending on how severe or low impact the issue really was. 

If it is high/emergency change department as well to a higher authority such as system administrator 

Whenever a ticket is updated it will reflect on a log for documentation

After it was resolved, it was removed from the open queue into the closed tickets list.

In this project I role played as both the end users and agents side of osTicket to simulate day to day experiences on both end of the parties.
